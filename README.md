# Microsoft Edge Remover
Edge Remover's goal is to remove Edge beyond just deleting its paths. With this batch, you'll be able to remove Edge's Appx, Edge Dev Tools, and leftovers like tasks, services, and startup keys.

# #5 No Console Verison
Removes Edge the fastest without any fancy visual batch elements! However any error or success messages won't output, the exception to no output being if the script wasn't ran as admin or setup.exe fails to install.
